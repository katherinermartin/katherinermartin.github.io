### Reptile immune system evolution

Building off of my dissertation work, I primarily use genomic and genetic data to understand how reptile immune systems evolve and to what extent adaptive variation at immune loci may enable reptile species to respond to disease.

Using reptile genomes, I hope to characterize the *major histocompatibility complex*

This includes characterizing what trends, if any, are common across reptile genomes, and

## The genomic and evolutionary implications of hybridization

As part of my post doctoral work in the [Everson lab](https://www.eversonlab.org/), I am working to characterize the signals of hybridization within the _Eulemur_ genus of Malagasy lemurs. By taking a whole genome approach, we hope to

## Gene expression across life stages, species, and disease status to understand an infectious sea turtle disease

Using RNA sequencing data, I am exploring how gene expression is different in two sea turtle species differentially impacted by the infectious tumor disease fibropapillomatosis. Preliminarily, I have found distinct, species-specific differences in immune system response when diseased. Data generated from this study

### Immune gene diversity in sea turtles

A major component of my dissertation revolved around the extraordinarily diverse *major histocompatibility complex* (MHC) gene family, and how it's evolved across sea turtle species.

With my co-authors, I found that MHC genes in sea turtles are shared by species tens of millions of years diverged. While no one MHC allele was definitively linked to the occurrence of the infectious tumor disease fibropapillomatosis, we found that loggerhead (_Caretta caretta_) and green turtles (_Chelonia mydas_) have sizable MHC nucleotide and sequence diversity.
